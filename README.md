FarmOut out is a web application that allows small-scale farmers to automate their selling process. An automated bot handles orders which are routed to a to-do dashboard. This is an efficient alternative to texts and phone calls which are inconvenient to both the consumer and producer. Thus, this HackLassonde 2019 project aims to streamline this selling process. 

This project uses the very powerful Recast.ai bot builder for the chat application. For the frontend, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS were used to interpret JSON files from the server. Node.js, AlchemySQL, and Flask were used for the backend database maintanence. 

## Dashboard and Chatbot
This is an example of the dashboard. Everytime a user orders something through the chat, the database will be updated. 
The dashboard reads this information and displays the order details.

This is the chatbot. The user can log in and then speak with the AI to specify the order details. It is highly intelligent and seldom gts the wrong order. The order details, along with the time the consumer wants to pick it up, is then routed to the database.
